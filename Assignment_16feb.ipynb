    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer \n",
    "system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with\n",
    "the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.\n",
    "Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of\n",
    "tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated,\n",
    "controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational\n",
    "or distributed databases. SQL requires you to use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work \n",
    "with it. Also, all of your data must follow the same structure.  A NoSQL database has a dynamic schema for unstructured data.\n",
    "Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based, or organized as a \n",
    "key-value store. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having a defined structure first. Also, each \n",
    "document can have its own unique structure. "
